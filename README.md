The sticky notes app is a Full-Stack App that takes advantage of React, Material UI (React UI Library), and Firebase to allow users to make notes and save them.

The app uses Google Authentication to generate a Unique ID for each user, allowing for multiple user's notes to be stored on the same database while the firebase access rules as well as the JS code allow for users to only view and modify their respective content.
